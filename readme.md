# Niconico video trigger for Zapier platform

It can be used to trigger when a new video or live stream appeared on Niconico that matches a specific search string.

I cannot make the app public on the <https://zapier.com/> platform since I have no affiliation with Niconico service itself. I may only invite few people for testing purposes. Or you may use your own version of the app.

## Niconico API

* <https://site.nicovideo.jp/search-api-docs/snapshot> - documentation for the video search endpoint and TOS (in Japanese);

* <https://github.com/ra-gg/node-nicovideo-api> - information about user info endpoint is borrowed from that project.

Note: the [another version](https://site.nicovideo.jp/search-api-docs/search.html) of the search API was [discontinued](https://blog.nicovideo.jp/niconews/143630.html) at March 31st, 2021. There seem to be no way to get user ID for videos from the remaining search API.
